Was very nervous with Indian food catering since all items taste the same with the same masala in most Indian restaurants. They did a fantastic job with the food that was cooked on site in the hotel kitchen. The appetizers (wide selection) were excellent and especially the chat stand with a variety of pani puri, dhai puri and Bhel Puri and not to forget the cool mango lassi to compliment the various other drinks. The main meal was unique with a southIndian flavor with no garlic (on request) and the flavors were not the same masala in all dishes. The butter chicken and lamb dishes were a big hit. The desserts (3 different ones) were very good and especially the young and old alike devoured on the gulab jamuns. Overall the service and food was excellent and will highly recommend talking to the owner Karthik to get things going. Got value for our money.\"\n",

I tried the authentic chicken korma and mutton gravy with malabar poratta. Very great taste and loved how flaky poratta was.
